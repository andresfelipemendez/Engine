# Engine - A Showcase of Game Engine Development Skills

## Introduction
Welcome to "Engine" - my personal journey and portfolio in game engine development. Inspired by "Real Time Rendering," this project is a playground where I implement and explore various rendering APIs, showcasing my technical skills and learning experiences in the realm of game engine development.

## Rendering APIs
This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency across different rendering technologies. Each API choice reflects a unique aspect of my skillset:

- **OpenGL** (Work in Progress): Demonstrating foundational rendering techniques and optimizations.
- **Vulkan** (Planned): To explore and showcase low-level, high-efficiency graphics programming.
- **Direct3D** (Planned): Focused on leveraging Microsoft's widely-used API for high-performance games.
- **Metal** (Planned): Diving into Apple's Metal for iOS/macOS specific optimizations.

## Previous Work
My experience with Vulkan and Direct3D in separate projects has been pivotal in my growth as a game engine developer. These projects provide insight into my approach and depth in engine programming:
- [Vulkan Testing](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/VulkanTesting): A deep dive into Vulkan's capabilities.
- [DODE - Direct3D](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/DODE): Exploring the nuances of Direct3D.

## Hot Reloading Feature
I am integrating [hot reloading](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/hotreload) into this engine. This feature exemplifies my commitment to efficient development practices, enabling real-time updates and testing within the engine.

## Installation and Dependencies
To get started with reviewing my code, please follow the installation steps below. The project requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) for managing dependencies.

## Setup
in a terminal execute `set VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS=manifests` to enable manifest mode then
run `vcpkg install` to download dependencies 

### Dependencies
The project utilizes several libraries and frameworks, including:
- `entt`: Entity-component system.
- `glfw3`: Window management.
- `glm`: Mathematics for graphics.
- `imgui`: Immediate Mode GUI.
- `nlohmann-json`: JSON handling.
- `sqlite-orm`: Lightweight SQLite ORM.
- `tinygltf`: glTF loading.
... and others as listed in the vcpkg manifest.

## Build
run `build.bat`

## Usage and Demonstrations
Here, I provide examples and demonstrations showcasing various features and capabilities of the engine. This includes code snippets, screenshots, or video links that highlight the engine's performance and my implementation techniques.

## Todo List
- [x] Load models: Demonstrating model integration capabilities.
- [ ] Support multiple materials/shaders: To enhance visual versatility.
- [ ] Integrate IMGUI with Vulkan: For a robust GUI in Vulkan.
- [ ] Implement Animation: Showcasing dynamic and fluid object movements.

## About the Developer
I am a seasoned software developer with a decade of experience in game development, specializing in game engine architecture and data-oriented design. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in real-time rendering and efficient software architecture.

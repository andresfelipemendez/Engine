# Engine

Project to implement what I've learned from reading:
 - [Real Time Rendering](https://www.realtimerendering.com/)
  
The goal is to implement multiple rendering API's in the list is:
 - OpenGL <- WIP
 - Vulkan [TODO]
 - Direct3D [TODO]
 - Metal [TODO]

I've implemented versions of the previous API in other projects, but not multiples in the same app.
- [Vulkan](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/VulkanTesting)
- [Direct3D](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/DODE)

Eventually I plan to refactor to a Data Oriented Design architecture, which I've done in [preivous projects](https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/C-D3D11-Engine)

### todo:
- [ ] load models
- [ ] multiple materials/shaders
- [ ] vulkan IMGUI integration
- [ ] Animation
